This is a module for use in conjunction with the [Cypher System game system for Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/cyphersystem/). The Cypher SRD Compendium expands the Cypher System game system with compendia with material from the Cypher System Reference Document.

- **Abilities**
- **Ammo**.
- **Armor**, sorted by genre.
- **Artifacts**, sorted by genre.
- **Cyphers**, sorted by genre.
- **Equipment**, sorted by genre.
- **Meeples**, generic NPC tokens, in five colors for levels 1 through 10 with the corresponding default values, which you can use if you quickly need more NPCs on your map.
- **Scenes** with home scenes that can be used in theater-of-the-mind style games. There are different areas to sort your tokens on the scene.
- **Weapons**, sorted by genre.

Note that the compendia, especially the one with abilities, contain a large number of items. It’s not advised to import everything into a world, as that will hit performance and might even lead to crashes of Foundry. Only import what you really need. For most cases, no import is needed at all.

## Customizing Scenes

The scenes are all ready to go, but at the same time, can’t be customized. The one exception is `Home Scene [Template]`, which has the overlay set up as a tile, so that you can use your own custom backgrounds. For this to work, your background image must have a size of 4000×2250 px.

## Support and Community

The [Cypher FVTT Dev Discord](https://discord.gg/C5zGgtyhwa) is where the development of the system and this module is coordinated and their futures discussed, but anyone is welcome to join and share best practices, ask questions on how to use the system, and share self-created resources for your games.

You can also reach me on the [official Foundry Discord](https://discord.gg/foundryvtt) or via Discord DM: @mrkwnzl#7407.
